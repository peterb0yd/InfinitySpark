<h1> VectorRotation for JavaScript </h1>

- Run this version using the JavaScript add-on for processing

<h2> Differences between this and Java version </h2>

- Code is all in one file
- removed Enum.java file and converted axis enum values X, Y, Z to integer values 1, 2, 3
- Formatted for JavaScript - removed Float.isNaN() calls, String.isEmpty() calls, etc
- Renamed variables/functions that conflicted with JavaScript functions
