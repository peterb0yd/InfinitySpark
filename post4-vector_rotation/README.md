<h1> Vector Rotation GUI </h1>

- This GUI demonstrates vector rotations in 3 dimensions
- Made using <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a> and <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/05/02/easy-to-use-dynamic-texture-to-write-text-in-your-3d-object-with-threex-dot-dynamictexture-game-extensions-for-three-dot-js/">threex dynamic texture</a> extension for three.js
- Check out my rx.js file in the js folder, it's where I calculate the vector's rotated values. The sin values are negated oppositely than in my <a href="http://www.infinityspark.com/?p=370">post</a> because what we're seeing with our eyes is a reflection of what's being drawn in the screen.
