<h2> Post 5 Animations </h2> 

These animations represent the concepts of gradient, divergence and curl explained in <a href="http://www.infinityspark.com/a-bit-about-vector-functions-2/">A bit about Vector Functions</a> on www.infinityspark.com

Animations made using <a href="http://p5js.org/">p5 library</a> for javascript.

In order to run them all on the same page, I made each sketch an instance variable as <a href="https://github.com/lmccart/itp-creative-js/wiki/Spring-2014:-Week-5">explained here</a>.
